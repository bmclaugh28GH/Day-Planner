# Day Planner 

# Goal

Present a user with a day planner page into which they can view, add/modify and store "event" text per hour. 

The page must list a 9 hour window, 9a - 5p, and allow the user to enter a text for each. A SAVE button will let the user write the data to local storage. At page open it will display any data in local storage. Hours must have different BG colors based on how they relate to current hour. Past, current, and future hours must have different BG colors. 

# Stretch Goals, lol 

I aspire for this to allow user-selected days, or, at least, to be day aware when storing/retrieving. I'm hoping to add a date picker to the page, and maybe to store each set of hours' data by day in local storage. Like, the key part of the key-value pair could be day-planner-12-5-2019, or whatever. 

Why's there a SAVE button on every row, I wonder? I'm going to try putting one save button at the top, and gather all hour data at the same time. That means I need the jumbotron to be fixed, I think, which maybe it already is.
